# All about Sean
I began my journey in GIS during my senior year of college at CU Boulder. Initially, I was majoring in Anthropology and doing a certificate in GIS; I realized from my GIS certificate classes that I really enjoyed working with spatial data and the problem solving nature of GIS. I stayed an extra semester at CU to complete a second major in Geography. 
During my final semester at CU I worked as an Engineering intern for the City of Longmont, Colorado. After I graduated, a full time GIS technician position opened at Longmont; I successfully applied and got the job, where I currently work today.

As part of my duties as GIS technician I have focused on streamlining repetitive and inefficient workflows. I utilize many tools in my job, including Python packages like Geopandas and the ArcGIS API for Python, ESRI's Arcade expression language, and ArcGIS Model Builder. Currently I am learning to use Leaflet and Javascript to make my own online maps. I consider myself a lifelong learner, always eager to learn new ways to present GIS data.

When I'm not working you'll probably find me outside hiking or skiing. Right now I have an obsession with Colorado 14ers and I plan to drag many of my friends to their summits over the summer.
